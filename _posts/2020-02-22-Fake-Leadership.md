I've sat through more than one presentation where at the end, some higher level manager takes the presenters to task for lacking the right export control markings on an internal presentation, or some other procedural mistake. Insert obligatory remark about the importance of export control markings here, but comments like these strike me as something akin to bullying. It's an easy way to give a coarse reminder that you are in charge, but it doesn't elevate the discussion at hand or indicate any higher level thought. As a leader if this is what you consistently bring to the discussion, you've probably been over-promoted.
