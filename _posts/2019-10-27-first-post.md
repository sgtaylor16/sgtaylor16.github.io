# Kick Start

I think this is my third attempt at consistent blogging.  The first is lost to history.  The second is a wordpress site that as of this posting, is still out there under the same name I am using for this blog - TaylorSeries.  The purpose of the blog is severalfold that I am going to attempt to weave into something coherent.  First, I'm of the mind that writing helps you think more clearly.  Writing focuses you to orginize thoughts that are often otherwise a a heap of tangled thoughts in ones head. I'm going to primarily put my thoughts down on issues that concern my profession, engineering and program management. If I'm going to put the time into organizing and writing my thoughts, I might as well put them out there for others to read -it makes the writing a little more purposeful.  

The second purpose of the blog is to document and share my coding.  Over the last two or three year, my adventures in coding have consumed more of my time, in my personal life, as well as at work.  At work, my coding work primarily revolves around increasing use of python and data science.  At home it's that as well, but lately my time with Javascript is increaing markedly.  I've found that while python and data science are powerful tools that can give me and others fluent in python/noteboods etc. insight, that to share the results over a greater audience then coders, I need to be able to build web sites and apps to present the work.  Javascript gives me that ability. I'm running this blog on my github site where I'm also slowly posting code that I've created for one reason or another.  We'll see if it ever get's any traffic.

The third I guess is insurance.  I work in the aerospace industry - gas turbines (jet engines) specifically.  I'm happy at my job, doing interesting work in trying to put Ceramics in engines, but the aerospace industry has taken a few blows lately and the choice might not always be mine to stay in wehre I'm at.  Hopefully this site gives anyone who might be interested a little insight about me and my skills.
