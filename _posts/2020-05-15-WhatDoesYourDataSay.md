While I've been stuck at home, with at least periods of time with not a lot to do, I took this online course from Northwestern - [What Does Your Data Say](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/news/articles/2020/04/what-do-your-data-say.html). The course is led by a [Professor Madhav Mani](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/mani-madhav.html), in the Applied Mathematics department at Northwestern University.

The course is excellent. It's apparently an abbreviated version of a course Professor Mani offers at Northwestern. It's been a four week course that asks teaches you statistics while exercising your programming muscles. It hasn't covered any subjects that I wasn't aware of before, but it has successfully given me a deeper understanding of all of them, including in particular bootstraping and hypothesis testing.

The approach to teaching statistics is very fresh, I'd recommend this course if they decide to offer it again in some form after the pandemic.
