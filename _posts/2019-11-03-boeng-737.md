This is a little bit of a reckless post because I haven't read enough material to have what I would feel like is a fully informed opinion, but I've seen enough of coverage on the 737 NG tragedy to try and put a few thoughts down.

This post is not meant to be exculpatory to Boeing executives.  My opinion is that they put business interests ahead of customer safety - no matter their protestations to the contrary.  I would like to be more specific about where they deserve criticism, and think about what others who might find themselves wrapped up in similar circumstances might learn from this tragedy.
