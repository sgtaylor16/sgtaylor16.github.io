I'm working on a new development program right now - one that will require a reasonable amount of new hardware. I talked about the need for 
part trackers in the previous [post](https://sgtaylor16.github.io/2021/07/05/DataForProjectManagement.html). This post is about the code that 
I have written to try to create a simple to maintain database for a program's part tracker outside of Excel.
