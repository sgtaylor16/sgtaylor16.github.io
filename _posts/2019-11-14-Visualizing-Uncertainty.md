A tweet came across my feed about an article in Scientific American about visualizing uncertainty a while back. 
I noticed it because it was authored by a Professor from Northwestern University.  I finally got around to looking for the 
Professor tonight.  Her name is __Jessica Hullman__.  Quite a bit of the information and papers are pretty dense as you might expect.
But she also has a blog, and in one [article](https://medium.com/multiple-views-visualization-research-explained/uncertainty-visualization-explained-part-2-continuous-encodings-967a7f7c38d0)
 there were some cool techniques to visualize uncertainty in unemployment data.  From her blog post, here is how unemployment data is typically presented:

 She takes the same data and gives several different versions that help show the uncertainty around each of the data points.  Here is my favorite:
