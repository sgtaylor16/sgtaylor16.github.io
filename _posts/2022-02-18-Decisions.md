No matter your opinion on President Bush's decisions[^1], I'm writing here to praise the responsibility he is taking in this often panned sound-bite to take responsibility for making decisions.

Running programs for as long as I have, I think one of the traits in short supply is a willingness to make decisions. Organizational processes allow nearly anyone a clear path to kick the can down the road, and in my experience most people avail themselves of this option. More rare unfortunately, are people that have a bias to make a decision when it needs to be made. 

_An imperfect decision made now, may be better than the perfect decision made later._

[^1]: The 2nd Gulf War was a horrible decision with tragic consequences for millions.
