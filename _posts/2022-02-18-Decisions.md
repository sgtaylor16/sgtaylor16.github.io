No matter your opinion on President Bush's decisions[^1], I'm writing here to praise the responsibility he is taking in this often panned sound-bite to take responsibility for making decisions.

Running programs for as long as I have, I think one of the traits in short supply is a willingness to make decisions. Organizational processes allow nearly anyone a clear path to kick the can down the road, and in my experience most people avail themselves of this option. More rare unfortunately, are people that have a bias to make a decision when it needs to be made.

__Addendum March 11th 2020__

The quote above was mine. Something I've never used with someone else but I stumbled upon a different but better version of it in the sci-fi series by James Corey in book 6 _Babylon's Ashes_.

> A decent idea now is way better than a brilliant plan when it's too late 

If I morph mine a little with Corey's ...

> An imperfect decision made now, is better than the perfect one made too late.

[^1]: The 2nd Gulf War was a horrible decision with tragic consequences for millions.
