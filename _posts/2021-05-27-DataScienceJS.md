I use python and Notebooks often at work to explore data. It's an extremely powerful tool. The personal insight I get from exploring the data is great, but often it would be far more powerful if I could more easily __share__ the data and learning. Without a large audience with the ability to run python code or manipulate a notebook, my work falls goes unnoticed. In this [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/javascript-for-data-analysis-2e8e7dbf63a7), Mike Bostock argues that the solution is to do more work in JavaScript. His argument is that even if JS data analytics powers are more limited (today) than python or R, everyone has access to JS via their web browsers. Further Javascript is fast and is gaining capabilities all the time. He goes on to give many links regarding new and exciting libraries and capabilities built on JS. It's a very good read.
