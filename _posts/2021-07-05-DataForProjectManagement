The field of data science has burst on to the scene in the last decade. A requisite for this was the avalanche of data that our networked
world has made available to us. Data science and machine learning work best when they are presented with large amounts of data. Amounts 
that were not available in the past. I haven't seen much effort in the area of project management to collect data at the levels required
to use modern data science/ML and then explore uses for that data. I've been involved in project management for around twenty years. What 
counts as good project management hasn't evolved at all. Twenty four year old me could step into 2021 and recognize all the tools
(PowerPoint charts and Excel spreadsheets mostly) and processes that are used today. That's not a good thing.

What are the best opportunities for collecting data in hopes of applying modern data science/ML to program management? Below are what I think
are some of the best opportunities for harvesting data, followed by what you might be able to do with that data.

# Sources of Data

## Timekeeping

At least in companies that have defense contract business, detailed data is collected data by each person on what projects they worked on 
each day, and how many hours they worked on them. Unique charge codes are given to projects, and often projects inside of projects. That data]
is uploaded into some database. The reason this data is collected is for the US government and the company to agree on rates to pay by the hour
on government contracts, but it can be used for other purposes as well. Type of data that is in every entry in the database usually includes:

* Project Code - what project the time is being charged to.
* Date - What day the hours were applied to the project code.
* Cost - The cost of the hours
* Skill - Typically the person applying the hours has been assigned a skill (e.g. design, analysis, purchasing)
* Person - The name of the person charging.
* Department - The organization that the person belongs to.

## Part Trackers

I have experience at two (admittedly very old-school) aerospace companies - Honeywell and Rolls-Royce. My experience with these two is very 
consistent. When programs that requires a lot (~ 15 or more) of parts to design and make some type of crude (usually Excel) type of parts
tracker is created. The parts tracker keeps track of things like:

* The status of new drawings for parts.
* When orders are placed for new parts and for how much.
* Part quantities on hand (from which shortages can be calculated)
* Expected delivery
* Instrumentation status

One might ask why this information isn't track of in the enterprise wide databases that large companies have that keep track of similar
data on programs in production? The reason has been that the bueacracy invloved with adding data to these databases is too onerous to
move with the speed and low overhead that is needed for new product development.

## Meeting Notes

It may be able to parse program's meeting notes with __N__atural __L__anguage __P__rocessing (NLP) to gleam data regarding a program's
status and health.

## Milestone Trackers

Wouldn't it be great if we could use milestone trackers for something besides making people feel bad about themselves? I d

## Using the Data

Once we have figured out potential sources of data, we need to figure out how to make good use of it. Today, project plans are almost always
made entirely from MS Project Gannt charts. Gannt charts have an important role in nearly all plans but they promote the idea that programs march
orderly through distinct tasks. When one task completes, another one starts. This is not how any project I have worked on actually works.
Reality is much messier. But amidst that the messiness of real projects, repeatable patterns undoubtedly exist. Machining learning algorithms 
excel at finding the patterns in data - but it usually takes a lot of data. We need to start collecting that data from sources like the ones 
I mention above. Have you seen Moneyball?
