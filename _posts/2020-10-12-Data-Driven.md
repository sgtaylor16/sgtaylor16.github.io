Until I found this book I linked "big data" with Google, Facebook or databases. But Brunton and Kurt's book, [Data Driven Science and Engineering](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B07N4BK4CZ&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_FIqHFbHH1VH6V) shows that big data can be used in the physical world as well.

The overriding theme of the book whether it is discussing the SVD decomposition (_Chapter 1_), Fourier Analysis (_Chapter 2_), Compressed Sensing<sup>[1](#compressedsensing)</sup> (_Chapter 3_), or other chapters in the book is that viewing the big data through different lenses - _basis_ in mathematical speak - can reveal the fundamental structure and physics of a problem.

The book is very (for a textbook) readable, but if reading text books isn't your thing, Brunton is walking through the book and more in a fantastic series on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=steve+brunton)
