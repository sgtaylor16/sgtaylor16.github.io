Awhile back I read, audio book actually, a book on Charles DeGaulle by Jonathan Fenby.
  The book was very good, giving a good picture of a fairly pivotal figure who doesn't get a lot of play in American History.
   DeGaulle set high standards for arrogance and there is not much of his example that I'd like to try and copy.  
  But there was a quote from him on leadership that I really liked and try to follow:

  **"Great Leaders were those who moved beyond set hierarchies and regulations to take individual actions, aware of the risks but ready to accept them."**

  There's an unfortunate corollary to this quote which is, unfortunately also true.  Nassim Taleb recently tweeted the following aphorism:

**"Ambition accounts for 50% of success.  And 100% of failures."**
