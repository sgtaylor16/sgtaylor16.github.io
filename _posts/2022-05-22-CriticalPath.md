The title of this small post is a bit provocative. I have no doubt the idea of Critical Path is a key concept to understand for any program manager. Critical path is a useful heuristic. But heuristics can be abused, or overused at least, and I have come to think that we lean far too heavily on this one.

Why? My schedules are my best single-point estimate at a instant in time, but they are inevitably wrong - especially at the early stages of a program. If your plan's estimate is correct, or nearly so, then watching your critical path is enough to ensure you deliver on time.  *But, all plans are wrong.* If you believe this tenant to be true, then you don't really know your critical path. What you need to do, is be prepared as possible when a surprise causes a change to your plan and critical path. Having multiple options to complete your program is one of the ways to make your program [robust to surprises](https://sgtaylor16.github.io/2020/08/30/RiskRegisters.html), and nothing gives you options like time to react. Leaving everything for the last minute robs a program of an opportunity to recover from the surprises that occur later on.
