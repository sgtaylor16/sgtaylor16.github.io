My name is Scott Taylor.  You can get a glimpse of my professional career if you'd like it at my [Linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-taylor-4738904/).

This site has been built for a few related purposes.  First, I'm trying to become a better writer.  Many have said it before and I believe it to be true, writing clearly helps you think clearly.  I'd like to think clearly, so I'm writing.  Still, it seems somewhat pointless to write, if no one can read it, so I'm sharing it here.  My writing will focus mainly on subjects related to my career in engineering, but I'll go off on tangents on occasion.

I'm also trying to become a better coder / developer?.  I'm posting my most useful code to github and I'll link and talk about that code here.
